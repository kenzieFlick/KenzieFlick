# (Mac)Kenzie Flick(inger)
The following is a little overview of me, from being an engineer at Target to who I am as a person. I hope you can use this to better understand who I am, how I work, and how I grow in life! 

## About me 
I was born and raised in rural Western Minnesota in the city of Montevideo. I am a first-generation college student, graduating from the College of Saint Benedict-Saint John's University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, minoring in Math and spiritually triple-minoring in Choir, Art, and Environmental Science. I started my career at Target with a summer internship before my senior year of college in 2016 and have been with Target since, from being a TLP to an engineer. I enjoy birdwatching, insect/plant identification, hiking, swimming, reading, painting, drawing, playing video games, cooking and trying new foods, going out for a good beer, and talking about life. I am inspired and motivated by people all around me, so I love hearing all there is to know about others as well as learning from others' successes in similar walks of life.

## Who I am at Target
I am an Engineer who works on Android application development solutions alongside the rest of the MyDay application/Lego components team. I like focusing on clean, robust design patterns and solutions that are easy to apply throughout our expanding development process. Reducing tech debt and working toward established patterns makes future feature development with other teams much easier to attain. I enjoy opportunities to explore solutions to technical challenges and like learning and applying new knowledge every day.

## Who I am in life
I am a 23-year-old gal developing for a company I admire, all the while seeking involvement in environmental, community-based, and mentoring volunteer opportunities through and outside of work. I am learning more every day about how I learn and improve myself through work and volunteering obligations. I love interacting with people and enjoy hearing stories of all sorts! I like to be honest and transparent about my experiences in life and hope that by doing so, I encourage others to do the same!

## Personal working style
- I love working with others over working alone, though I do enjoy time to think up possible solutions to a problem on my own before mobbing on it.
- I tend to speak my thoughts aloud when thinking about something, especially the first time of hearing new information.
- I tend to go on tangents when discussing. If I start going off topic, don't hesitate to help me get back on track; it's appreciated!
- I am extroverted in most colloquial situations, but introverted when it comes to technical discussion as I need time to process and react.
- I have a hard time coherently responding on the spot; I usually need time to think of a response when thinking over new information.
- I am a very casual person and tend to not take notice of job titles or who you are in context to me; if my informality makes you uncomfortable, please feel free to enforce formalities.
- I like to ask a lot of questions and take notes while people are explaining something to me, mostly because my auditory absorption is not the best, so I need the reinforcement of note-taking and clarification to help with memory. 
- I take notes and stay quiet in large meetings, especially ones with people having technical discussions, but if I feel I have something to immediately contribute to the conversation, I will chime in.
- I sometimes go down the rabbit hole of understanding and solving something. This is where it is nice to work on a team so  I can be reminded to take a step back, ask questions, and maintain accountability for getting work done as a team.

I am always looking for opportunities to grow as an engineer at the beginning of my career. If you have any suggestions for improving skills of a newbie engineer, I would love to hear them and actively work through something! My career doesn't feel meaningful if I am not bettering myself every day.

## Contacting me
- Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn. I am also easy to find on various other social media platforms and you are more than welcome to engage me on any of those as well.
